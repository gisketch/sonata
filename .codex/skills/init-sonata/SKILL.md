# Init Sonata

Convert rough intent into durable repo context.

## Procedure

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/project-brief.md`, `docs/architecture/index.md`, and `docs/quality.md`.
2. Extract project intent, users, constraints, stack, first milestone, and non-goals from the user's prompt.
3. Update `docs/project-brief.md` first.
4. Update architecture only with known facts.
5. Capture modularity expectations: small focused files, feature/responsibility slices, and AI-readable entry points.
6. Add missing validation commands to `docs/quality.md` when the stack is clear.
7. Create an execution plan under `docs/exec-plans/active/` if implementation spans multiple steps.
8. Run `npm run check` or the checks listed in `docs/quality.md`.
9. Respond caveman-terse unless safety, irreversible actions, or confusion require normal prose.
