# Agent Map

Project: {{projectName}}

Primary agent: {{primaryAgent}}
Enabled agents: {{agentTargets}}

Codex reads this file first. Keep it short. It is the map, not the manual.

## Default Behavior

- Read [docs/index.md](docs/index.md) before large changes.
- Default to caveman style for chat: terse, exact, no filler. Use normal prose only for safety, irreversible actions, or user confusion.
- Stay inside harness engineering: repo-local context, small maps, execution plans, checks, and doc updates.
- For new product context, use `/init-sonata` and update [docs/project-brief.md](docs/project-brief.md).
- For existing project cleanup or migration, use `/retrofit-sonata` before feature work.
- For multi-step work, create or update an execution plan in [docs/exec-plans/active](docs/exec-plans/active).
- Run checks from [docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md) before final handoff.
- If an agent struggles twice on the same class of issue, add a doc, script, test, fixture, or rule.

## Knowledge Map

- [docs/project-brief.md](docs/project-brief.md): product intent and constraints.
- [docs/core-beliefs.md](docs/core-beliefs.md): harness philosophy, including small-file modularity.
- [docs/architecture/index.md](docs/architecture/index.md): structure and boundaries.
- [docs/quality.md](docs/quality.md): validation commands.
- [docs/exec-plans/README.md](docs/exec-plans/README.md): planning workflow.
- [docs/references/harness-engineering.md](docs/references/harness-engineering.md): harness principles.
- [docs/references/caveman.md](docs/references/caveman.md): compression rules.

## Current Project Facts

## Work Loop

1. Clarify goal and acceptance criteria.
2. Read only relevant docs.
3. Plan at the smallest useful level.
4. Implement inside documented boundaries.
5. Validate with current checks.
6. Update docs when behavior, decisions, or constraints change.
