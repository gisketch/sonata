# Claude Code Instructions

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first. It is the map.

Default behavior:

- Caveman style for chat: terse, exact, no filler.
- Harness engineering always: repo-local context, execution plans, checks, and doc updates.
- Use `init-sonata` for project-context initialization.
- Use `retrofit-sonata` for existing project cleanup, doc migration, and harness normalization.
- Use `caveman-sonata` for implementation work.
- Use normal prose for safety warnings, irreversible actions, or user confusion.

Do not expand this file into a manual. Put durable project knowledge in `docs/`.
