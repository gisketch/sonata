# Retrofit Sonata

Turn existing project into Sonata-compatible harness.

Rules:

- Inventory before edits.
- Preserve useful docs by moving, linking, or summarizing into `docs/`.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` short.
- Keep Codex first unless user requests otherwise.
- Put verified commands in `docs/quality.md`.
- Put broad/risky work in `docs/exec-plans/active/`.
- Run `./scripts/check-sonata.sh`.
- Caveman-terse output unless safety or confusion requires normal prose.

Do not change app behavior unless explicitly requested.
